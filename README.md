# e-MDB configuration files for launching experiments

In this repository, you can find experiments developed by the GII that use the e-MDB cognitive architecture. At this moment, two experiments are implemented:

- **Default experiment**: Experiment implemented using a Discrete Event Simulator that simulates, without physics, the Baxter robot, which has two arms.

- **Oscar experiment**: Experiment using two robotic arms in Gazebo.

The *experiments* ROS package includes the YAML files that configure the experiments and the launch files to run them.

You can find information and tutorials about this repository and the others that are part of the e-MDB cognitive architecture software in the [PILLAR Robots official documentation](https://docs.pillar-robots.eu/en/latest/)
