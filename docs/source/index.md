# e-MDB Experiments implemented by the GII

In this repository, you can find experiments developed by the GII that use the e-MDB cognitive architecture. At this moment, two experiments are implemented:

- [Default experiment](experiments/default_experiment.md): Experiment implemented using a Discrete Event Simulator that simulates, without physics, the Baxter robot, which has two arms.

- [Oscar experiment](https://www.marca.com): Experiment using two robotic arms in Gazebo.

You can find more information about each experiment in its respective section.
